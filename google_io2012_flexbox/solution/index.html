    			When attempting to control page layout, it's great to be able to adapt the layout dynamically.
    			It's also useful to be able to decouple the content order from the display order.
    		  </p>
    		  <p>
    			This example layout reflects what some people called the 'Holy Grail' of layout.
    			To date, this style of layout has been difficult to achieve.
    			The Flexible Box layout module makes this layout easy.
    		  </p>
    		  <p>
    			One of the great things about this particular layout is that the document order is independent of the display order.
    			This means that screen readers can read the document content first, whilst a visual user agent places the navigation before the article.

    			Note, that this achieves layout capability that might have been done with tables, but the semantic flow of the document is uninterrupted.
    			Also, it's possible to 'flex' the individual items independently giving powerful layout control.
